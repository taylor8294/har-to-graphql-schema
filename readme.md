# HAR to GraphQL Schema

**har-to-graphql-schema** is a Node.js tool designed to extract GraphQL schema information from a HTTP Archive (HAR) file of a browser session clicking through a website. It is a tool I threw together to provide similar functionality to the well-known Burp Suite extension [GraphQuail](https://github.com/forcesunseen/graphquail) but that can act on a HAR file saved from a previous browser session, rather than performing the analysis live as the calls are being made through Burp Suite. Another similar tool you may be interested in is [clairvoyance](https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance).

## Introduction

GraphQL is increasingly used for APIs due to its flexibility and efficiency. However, understanding the schema behind a GraphQL API can be challenging without access to the server's schema files.

Say there is a website that uses a GraphQL endpoint that you want to know the schema for, but the endpoint does not have introspection enabled. If you can't browse the website through a Burp Suite proxy to make use of the [GraphQuail](https://github.com/forcesunseen/graphquail) extension, this tool gives you another option. You can browse the website from a browser such as Google Chrome with the Dev Tools network tab open, then once a lot of graphQL calls have been recorded in the nework tab, you can right-click 'Save all as HAR with content'. You can then run **har-to-graphql-schema** to scrape the HAR file to pull out what defined types, query names, mutations, and other schema information is visible from the GraphQL calls the browser was making during the session. The scraped information is output in standard Schema Definition Language (SDL) format. This makes it easier for developers and security testers to understand the schema behind the GraphQL endpoint.

Currently the output assigns a type of `JSON` to any fields it cannot determine the type of (similar to [GraphQuail](https://github.com/forcesunseen/graphquail)'s `UnknownScalar`).

## Features

- Extracts GraphQL schema from HAR files
- Outputs schema in SDL format
- Supports types, inputs, fragments, queries, and mutations
- Easy-to-use script

## Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Clone this repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies (just `graphql-js` to parse an AST from the queries in the HAR).

## Usage

To use the tool edit the `sample.har` filename in line 11 of `har-to-graphql-schema.js` to the name of your HAR file.

You may need to edit lines 14 and 15, the logic that filters the entries in the HAR file to include only the relevent GraphQL calls, to meet your specific needs.

## Example

Suppose you have a HAR file with the following GraphQL request and response:

```json
{
  "log": {
    "version": "1.2",
    "creator": {
      "name": "WebInspector",
      "version": "537.36"
    },
    "entries": [
      {
        "startedDateTime": "2024-05-01T12:00:00.000Z",
        "time": 200,
        "request": {
          "method": "POST",
          "url": "https://example.com/graphql",
          "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
          "headers": [
            {
              "name": "Content-Type",
              "value": "application/json"
            }
          ],
          "postData": {
            "mimeType": "application/json",
            "text": "{\"query\":\"{ user(id: \\\"1\\\") { name email __typename } }\"}"
          }
        },
        "response": {
          "status": 200,
          "statusText": "OK",
          "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
          "headers": [
            {
              "name": "Content-Type",
              "value": "application/json"
            }
          ],
          "content": {
            "size": 123,
            "mimeType": "application/json",
            "text": "{\"data\": { \"user\": { \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\", \"__typename\": \"User\" } }}"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Running **har-to-graphql-schema** on it will output:

```graphql
type User {
  name: String
  email: String
}

type Query {
  user(id: String): User
}
```
